<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The LogWatch module will start logging PHP errors automatically upon installation. To begin capturing logs, simply navigate through your front-end site. The module will monitor and record any PHP errors that occur during your siteâ€™s operation.</p>
<p>You have the flexibility to customize which events you want to log. This can be done by adjusting the settings in the LogWatch module. In the settings, you can specify the types of errors and events you want to track, ensuring that you only log relevant information.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

To do this, you can use the {LogWatch} tag on any of your front-end pages. This tag will display a series of action buttons that allow you to trigger different types of PHP errors manually. These buttons are useful for verifying that the module is correctly logging errors and for testing various error handling scenarios.</p>
